# tiktok_use_analysis

This repository contains a notebook for scraping data using url's in my downloaded tiktok data, transforming it then visualising it.

**Overview**: I downloaded my tiktok data, to find trends in my liked posts, login frequency and performed sentiment analysis on the comments I leave on other people's posts. The actual json file containing my tiktok data is not included for privacy purposes, and to hide the profanity I use (in a positive manner of course).
